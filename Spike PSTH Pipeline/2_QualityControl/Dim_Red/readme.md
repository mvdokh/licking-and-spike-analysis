there are multiple 'lines' in each frame. the lines are essentially just a couple of points that get connected by a line. the pixels that correspond to those points are listed as "x", "y" with multiple x and y points. 

I want you to write a script and create an interactive jupyter notebook to perform dimensionality reduction on this list to cluster by similar lines

PSTH Heatmap

Create a heatmap (in the 4_PSTH-heatmap folder) that combines the PSTH of each units. Essentially, each unit should be plotted in ascending order on the Y axis, and on the x axis it should be the firing rate at time. 

This means that I will have to specify a pico_time_adjust.csv file and spikes.csv file. 

I want to be able to specify the interval duration from which the PSTH is to be created, and the time before and after, also the bin size

All units should be plotted, different graph for each interval duration
X axis: firing rate at time
Y axis: unit

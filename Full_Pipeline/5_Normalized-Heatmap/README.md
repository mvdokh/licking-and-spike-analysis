Z-Score Noprmalized Heatmap

z = (x - u) / o

z = z-score
x = one bin's value (frequency)
u = mean of all bins for the same unit 
o = standard deviation of all bins for one unit 

I want 

start_time = None              # Start time for filtering in seconds (optional)
end_time = None                # End time for filtering in seconds (optional)
